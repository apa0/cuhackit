Clemson University 2024-2025 Undergraduate Catalog
Computer Science, BS
Program Description
The Computer Science program is oriented toward design, implementation, and application of software systems to solve informa-
tion processing problems. This program is more technically oriented than the Computer Information Systems curriculum. It pre-
pares students for employment in the computer software field or for continued study toward an advanced degree in computer
science.
The Bachelor of Science in Computer Science program is accredited by the Computing Accreditation Commission of ABET,
https://www.abet.org, under the General Criteria and the Computer Science and Similarly Named Computing Programs Program
Criteria. Visit the Computer Science program’s website to learn about the Program Educational Objectives and Student Outcomes.
Students who change majors into Computer Science must have a cumulative grade-point average of 2.0 or higher.
Bachelor’s to Master’s Plan
The School of Computing allows students to apply up to nine hours of graduate credit (6000- and 8000-level courses) toward both
the bachelor’s and master’s degrees. Students participating in this program must have a minimum grade-point average of 3.4 and
be admitted to the Graduate School prior to registering for graduate courses. Details of the suggested curriculum and program in-
formation are available from the School.
